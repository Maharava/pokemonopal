# Pokémon Opal Engine

This project aims to faithfully recreate the classic Game Boy Color game Pokémon Crystal using Python and Pygame. The goal is to build an engine that accurately mimics the original game's mechanics, graphics, and feel.

## Current Features:

*   **Map Rendering:** Renders game maps using original tilesets and metatile data.
*   **Palette System:** Accurate recreation of the Game Boy Color's 4-color palette system, including proper color application and handling of indexed graphics.
*   **Tile Animations:** Implements animations for environmental elements like water and flowers, mimicking the original game's frame-based and timer-driven animation logic.

## Development Goals:

*   **Faithful Recreation:** Adhere as closely as possible to the original game's assembly logic and asset usage.
*   **Modularity:** Organize the codebase into logical, reusable components.
*   **Extensibility:** Design the engine to be easily expandable for future features (e.g., character movement, battle system, UI).

## How to Run:

(Instructions will be added here as the project progresses and becomes more runnable for end-users.)
